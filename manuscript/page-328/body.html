<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: See now, most excellent Callicles, how different my charge against you is from that which you bring against me, for you reproach me with always saying the same; but I reproach you with never saying the same about the same things, for at one time you were defining the better and the superior to be the stronger, then again as the wiser, and now you bring forward a new notion; the superior and the better are now declared by you to be the more courageous: I wish, my good friend, that you would tell me, once for all, whom you affirm to be the better and superior, and in what they are better?</p><p>CALLICLES: I have already told you that I mean those who are wise and courageous in the administration of a state&mdash;they ought to be the rulers of their states, and justice consists in their having more than their subjects.</p></div> </div>
