And therefore I am justified in saying that rhetoric treats of discourse.</p><p>SOCRATES: I am not sure whether I entirely understand you, but I dare say I shall soon know better; please to answer me a question:&mdash;you would allow that there are arts?</p><p>GORGIAS: Yes.</p><p>SOCRATES: As to the arts generally, they are for the most part concerned with doing, and require little or no speaking; in painting, and statuary, and many other arts, the work may proceed in silence; and of such arts I suppose you would say that they do not come within the province of rhetoric.</p></div> </div>
