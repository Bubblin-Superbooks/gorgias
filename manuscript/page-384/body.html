<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: But who else is willing?&mdash;I want to finish the argument.</p><p>CALLICLES: Cannot you finish without my help, either talking straight on, or questioning and answering yourself?</p><p>SOCRATES: Must I then say with Epicharmus, 'Two men spoke before, but now one shall be enough'? I suppose that there is absolutely no help. And if I am to carry on the enquiry by myself, I will first of all remark that not only I but all of us should have an ambition to know what is true and what is false in this matter, for the discovery of the truth is a common good. And now I will proceed to argue according to my own notion. But if any of you think that I arrive at conclusions which are untrue you must interpose and refute me, for I do not speak from any knowledge of what I am saying; I am an enquirer like yourselves, and therefore, if my opponent says anything which is of force, I shall be the first to agree with him.</p></div> </div>
