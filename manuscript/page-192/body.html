Do you know any other effect of rhetoric over and above that of producing persuasion?</p><p>GORGIAS: No: the definition seems to me very fair, Socrates; for persuasion is the chief end of rhetoric.</p><p>SOCRATES: Then hear me, Gorgias, for I am quite sure that if there ever was a man who entered on the discussion of a matter from a pure love of knowing the truth, I am such a one, and I should say the same of you.</p></div> </div>
