<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Third Thesis:&mdash;</p><p>We do not what we will, but what we wish.</p><p>Socrates would teach us a lesson which we are slow to learn&mdash;that good intentions, and even benevolent actions, when they are not prompted by wisdom, are of no value. We believe something to be for our good which we afterwards find out not to be for our good. The consequences may be inevitable, for they may follow an invariable law, yet they may often be the very opposite of what is expected by us. When we increase pauperism by almsgiving; when we tie up property without regard to changes of circumstances; when we say hastily what we deliberately disapprove; when we do in a moment of passion what upon reflection we regret; when from any want of self-control we give another an advantage over us&mdash;we are doing not what we will, but what we wish.</p></div> </div>
