<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: There again, noble Polus, you are raising hobgoblins instead of refuting me; just now you were calling witnesses against me. But please to refresh my memory a little; did you say&mdash;'in an unjust attempt to make himself a tyrant'?</p><p>POLUS: Yes, I did.</p><p>SOCRATES: Then I say that neither of them will be happier than the other,&mdash;neither he who unjustly acquires a tyranny, nor he who suffers in the attempt, for of two miserables one cannot be the happier, but that he who escapes and becomes a tyrant is the more miserable of the two. Do you laugh, Polus? Well, this is a new kind of refutation,&mdash;when any one says anything, instead of refuting him to laugh at him.</p></div> </div>
