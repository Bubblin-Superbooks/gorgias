<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>POLUS: A proposition which is harder of refutation than the other, Socrates.</p><p>SOCRATES: Say rather, Polus, impossible; for who can refute the truth?</p><p>POLUS: What do you mean? If a man is detected in an unjust attempt to make himself a tyrant, and when detected is racked, mutilated, has his eyes burned out, and after having had all sorts of great injuries inflicted on him, and having seen his wife and children suffer the like, is at last impaled or tarred and burned alive, will he be happier than if he escape and become a tyrant, and continue all through life doing what he likes and holding the reins of government, the envy and admiration both of citizens and strangers? Is that the paradox which, as you say, cannot be refuted?</p></div> </div>
