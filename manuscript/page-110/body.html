Because politics, and perhaps human life generally, are of a mixed nature we must not allow our principles to sink to the level of our practice.</p><p>And so of private individuals&mdash;to them, too, the world occasionally speaks of the consequences of their actions:&mdash;if they are lovers of pleasure, they will ruin their health; if they are false or dishonest, they will lose their character. But Socrates would speak to them, not of what will be, but of what is&mdash;of the present consequence of lowering and degrading the soul. And all higher natures, or perhaps all men everywhere, if they were not tempted by interest or passion, would agree with him&mdash;</p></div> </div>
