<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>CALLICLES: Are you not ashamed, Socrates, of introducing such topics into the argument?</p><p>SOCRATES: Well, my fine friend, but am I the introducer of these topics, or he who says without any qualification that all who feel pleasure in whatever manner are happy, and who admits of no distinction between good and bad pleasures? And I would still ask, whether you say that pleasure and good are the same, or whether there is some pleasure which is not a good?</p><p>CALLICLES: Well, then, for the sake of consistency, I will say that they are the same.</p><p>SOCRATES: You are breaking the original agreement, Callicles, and will no longer be a satisfactory companion in the search after truth, if you say what is contrary to your real opinion.</p></div> </div>
