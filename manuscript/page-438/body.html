<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>CALLICLES: And do you think, Socrates, that a man who is thus defenceless is in a good position?</p><p>SOCRATES: Yes, Callicles, if he have that defence, which as you have often acknowledged he should have&mdash;if he be his own defence, and have never said or done anything wrong, either in respect of gods or men; and this has been repeatedly acknowledged by us to be the best sort of defence. And if any one could convict me of inability to defend myself or others after this sort, I should blush for shame, whether I was convicted before many, or before a few, or by myself alone; and if I died from want of ability to do so, that would indeed grieve me. But if I died because I have no powers of flattery or rhetoric, I am very sure that you would not find me repining at death. For no man who is not an utter fool and coward is afraid of death itself, but he is afraid of doing wrong.</p></div> </div>
