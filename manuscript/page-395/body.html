Am I not right Callicles?</p><p>CALLICLES: Yes, quite right.</p><p>SOCRATES: Seeing then that there are these two evils, the doing injustice and the suffering injustice&mdash;and we affirm that to do injustice is a greater, and to suffer injustice a lesser evil&mdash;by what devices can a man succeed in obtaining the two advantages, the one of not doing and the other of not suffering injustice? must he have the power, or only the will to obtain them? I mean to ask whether a man will escape injustice if he has only the will to escape, or must he have provided himself with the power?</p></div> </div>
