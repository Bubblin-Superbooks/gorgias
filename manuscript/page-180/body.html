Will you keep your promise, and answer shortly the questions which are asked of you?</p><p>GORGIAS: Some answers, Socrates, are of necessity longer; but I will do my best to make them as short as possible; for a part of my profession is that I can be as short as any one.</p><p>SOCRATES: That is what is wanted, Gorgias; exhibit the shorter method now, and the longer one at some other time.</p><p>GORGIAS: Well, I will; and you will certainly say, that you never heard a man use fewer words.</p></div> </div>
