<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: And now let us have from you, Gorgias, the truth about rhetoric: which you would admit (would you not?) to be one of those arts which act always and fulfil all their ends through the medium of words?</p><p>GORGIAS: True.</p><p>SOCRATES: Words which do what? I should ask. To what class of things do the words which rhetoric uses relate?</p><p>GORGIAS: To the greatest, Socrates, and the best of human things.</p><p>SOCRATES: That again, Gorgias is ambiguous; I am still in the dark: for which are the greatest and best of human things? I dare say that you have heard men singing at feasts the old drinking song, in which the singers enumerate the goods of life, first health, beauty next, thirdly, as the writer of the song says, wealth honestly obtained.</p></div> </div>
