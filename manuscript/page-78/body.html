<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> 'And do you think that a man who is unable to help himself is in a good condition?' Yes, Callicles, if he have the true self-help, which is never to have said or done any wrong to himself or others. If I had not this kind of self-help, I should be ashamed; but if I die for want of your flattering rhetoric, I shall die in peace. For death is no evil, but to go to the world below laden with offences is the worst of evils. In proof of which I will tell you a tale:&mdash;</p><p>Under the rule of Cronos, men were judged on the day of their death, and when judgment had been given upon them they departed&mdash;the good to the islands of the blest, the bad to the house of vengeance.</p></div> </div>
