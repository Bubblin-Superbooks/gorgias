<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is a greater evil to do than to suffer injustice.</p><p>Compare the New Testament&mdash;</p><p>'It is better to suffer for well doing than for evil doing.'&mdash;1 Pet.</p><p>And the Sermon on the Mount&mdash;</p><p>'Blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness' sake.'&mdash;Matt.</p><p>The words of Socrates are more abstract than the words of Christ, but they equally imply that the only real evil is moral evil. The righteous may suffer or die, but they have their reward; and even if they had no reward, would be happier than the wicked. The world, represented by Polus, is ready, when they are asked, to acknowledge that injustice is dishonourable, and for their own sakes men are willing to punish the offender (compare Republic). But they are not equally willing to acknowledge that injustice, even if successful, is essentially evil, and has the nature of disease and death.</p></div> </div>
