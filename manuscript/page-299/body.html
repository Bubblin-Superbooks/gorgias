<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: O Callicles, if there were not some community of feelings among mankind, however varying in different persons&mdash;I mean to say, if every man's feelings were peculiar to himself and were not shared by the rest of his species&mdash;I do not see how we could ever communicate our impressions to one another. I make this remark because I perceive that you and I have a common feeling. For we are lovers both, and both of us have two loves apiece:&mdash;I am the lover of Alcibiades, the son of Cleinias, and of philosophy; and you of the Athenian Demus, and of Demus the son of Pyrilampes. Now, I observe that you, with all your cleverness, do not venture to contradict your favourite in any word or opinion of his; but as he changes you change, backwards and forwards.</p></div> </div>
