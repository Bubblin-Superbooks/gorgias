<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The new order of the world was immediately under the government of God; it was a state of innocence in which men had neither wants nor cares, in which the earth brought forth all things spontaneously, and God was to man what man now is to the animals. There were no great estates, or families, or private possessions, nor any traditions of the past, because men were all born out of the earth. This is what Plato calls the 'reign of Cronos;' and in like manner he connects the reversal of the earth's motion with some legend of which he himself was probably the inventor.</p><p>The question is then asked, under which of these two cycles of existence was man the happier,&mdash;under that of Cronos, which was a state of innocence, or that of Zeus, which is our ordinary life?</p></div> </div>
