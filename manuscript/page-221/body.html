<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>POLUS: What condition?</p><p>SOCRATES: That you contract, Polus, the prolixity of speech in which you indulged at first.</p><p>POLUS: What! do you mean that I may not use as many words as I please?</p><p>SOCRATES: Only to think, my friend, that having come on a visit to Athens, which is the most free-spoken state in Hellas, you when you got there, and you alone, should be deprived of the power of speech&mdash;that would be hard indeed. But then consider my case:&mdash;shall not I be very hardly used, if, when you are making a long oration, and refusing to answer what you are asked, I am compelled to stay and listen to you, and may not go away? I say rather, if you have a real interest in the argument, or, to repeat my former expression, have any desire to set it on its legs, take back any statement which you please; and in your turn ask and answer, like myself and Gorgias&mdash;</p></div> </div>
