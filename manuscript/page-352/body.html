<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>CALLICLES: Yes.</p><p>SOCRATES: But he does not cease from good and evil at the same moment, as you have admitted: do you still adhere to what you said?</p><p>CALLICLES: Yes, I do; but what is the inference?</p><p>SOCRATES: Why, my friend, the inference is that the good is not the same as the pleasant, or the evil the same as the painful; there is a cessation of pleasure and pain at the same moment; but not of good and evil, for they are different. How then can pleasure be the same as good, or pain as evil? And I would have you look at the matter in another light, which could hardly, I think, have been considered by you when you identified them: Are not the good good because they have good present with them, as the beautiful are those who have beauty present with them?</p></div> </div>
