<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And I say that if a rhetorician and a physician were to go to any city, and had there to argue in the Ecclesia or any other assembly as to which of them should be elected state-physician, the physician would have no chance; but he who could speak would be chosen if he wished; and in a contest with a man of any other profession the rhetorician more than any one would have the power of getting himself chosen, for he can speak more persuasively to the multitude than any of them, and on any subject. Such is the nature and power of the art of rhetoric! And yet, Socrates, rhetoric should be used like any other competitive art, not against everybody,&mdash;the rhetorician ought not to abuse his strength any more than a pugilist or pancratiast or other master of fence;&mdash;because he has powers which are more than a match either for friend or enemy, he ought not therefore to strike, stab, or slay his friends.</p></div> </div>
