<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And to Minos I shall give the primacy, and he shall hold a court of appeal, in case either of the two others are in any doubt:&mdash;then the judgment respecting the last journey of men will be as just as possible.'</p><p>From this tale, Callicles, which I have heard and believe, I draw the following inferences:&mdash;Death, if I am right, is in the first place the separation from one another of two things, soul and body; nothing else. And after they are separated they retain their several natures, as in life; the body keeps the same habit, and the results of treatment or accident are distinctly visible in it: for example, he who by nature or training or both, was a tall man while he was alive, will remain as he was, after he is dead; and the fat man will remain fat; and so on; and the dead man, who in life had a fancy to have flowing hair, will have flowing hair.</p></div> </div>
